This documentation explains how you can contribute to EasyBuild,
and discusses the review process for contributions.

<span class="gh">How to contribute</span>
<span class="gh">-----------------</span>

It is a common misconception that contributing to an open source project
requires being intimately familiar with its codebase.

There are various ways to contribute, even if you don&#39;t have any experience
with the programming language(s) being used by the project you are interested in.

You can contribute to EasyBuild by:

<span class="m">*</span> <span class="na">:ref:</span><span class="nv">`contributing_feedback`</span>

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_feedback:</span>

<span class="gh">Giving feedback</span>
<span class="gh">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>

An easy way to contribute to EasyBuild, even without having a lot of
hands-on experience with it, is to <span class="gs">**provide feedback**</span> on your experiences.

Feedback from people new to EasyBuild is valuable, since it provides
a perspective that is easily overlooked by more experienced users.

You can contact the EasyBuild community via the EasyBuild mailing
list (<span class="s">``easybuild@lists.ugent.be``</span>), the <span class="s">``#easybuild``</span> IRC channel (see also <span class="na">:ref:</span><span class="nv">`getting_help`</span>).

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_bugs:</span>

<span class="gh">Reporting bugs</span>
<span class="gh">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>

If you run into unexpected problems when using EasyBuild, please <span class="gs">**open a bug report**</span>
in the issue tracker of the relevant GitHub repository:

<span class="m">*</span> https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/issues: for general problems with <span class="s">``eb``</span>, the EasyBuild framework, etc.
<span class="m">*</span> https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/issues: for problems specific to a particular (generic or software-specific) easyblock, etc.
<span class="m">*</span> https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/issues: for problems specific to a particular software package,
  e.g., with building and installing a particular version of that software, or when using a particular toolchain, etc.
<span class="m">*</span> https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild/issues: for problems with the EasyBuild documentation, etc.

Please try and provide all relevant information, which may include:

<span class="m">*</span> the EasyBuild version you are using
<span class="m">*</span> the specifics of the system you are using, incl. OS + version, Python version, modules tool &amp; version, etc.
<span class="m">*</span> the active EasyBuild configuration; usually the output of <span class="s">``eb --show-config``</span> is sufficient
<span class="m">*</span> the full <span class="s">``eb``</span> command line that was used
<span class="m">*</span> warning or error messages, or other relevant informative messages
<span class="m">*</span> filename or contents of easyconfig file(s) being used
<span class="m">*</span> EasyBuild log file (for example via https://gist.github.com/), preferably collected with <span class="s">``eb --debug``</span>

<span class="gh">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>

Try and <span class="gs">**help others**</span> based on your experience, or help them figure out an answer to their question
or a solution to their problem using the EasyBuild documentation or by reaching out
to someone else in the EasyBuild community that may know the answer.

The EasyBuild community is known to be very welcoming and helpful, and you too can be a part of that.


<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_easyconfigs:</span>

<span class="gh">Contributing easyconfig files</span>
<span class="gh">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>

Please <span class="gs">**contribute easyconfig files**</span> that are not included yet in
(the <span class="s">``develop``</span> branch of) the <span class="s">``easybuild-easyconfigs``</span> GitHub repository at
https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs.

This includes easyconfigs for software that is not supported yet by EasyBuild,
as well as updates to existing easyconfigs (e.g., version updates, using a
different toolchain, etc.), even if you consider the updates to be trivial.
Keep in mind that being able to use something that is known to work out-of-the-box
can save quite a bit of time compared to having to tweak existing easyconfigs
and validate the result installations.

We highly recommend using the <span class="s">``--new-pr``</span> and <span class="s">``--update-pr``</span> command
line options for contributing easyconfig files; see <span class="na">:ref:</span><span class="nv">`github_new_update_pr`</span>.


<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_code:</span>

<span class="gh">Contributing code changes</span>
<span class="gh">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>

Of course you can also <span class="gs">**contribute code changes**</span>, including bug fixes,
enhancements or additional features in the EasyBuild framework, the easyblocks repository,
the test suites or in related scripts.

Do keep in mind that this requires some experience with Python,
although you should be able to go a long way by using the existing code base as support.

See <span class="na">:ref:</span><span class="nv">`contributing_pull_requests`</span> for more information on the practical
aspects of contributing code.


<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_docs:</span>

<span class="gh">Writing documentation</span>
<span class="gh">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>

Another way to contribute to EasyBuild without having to implement Python
code is by <span class="gs">**writing documentation**</span>, i.e. enhancing or updating existing
documentation or documenting features that are not covered yet.

To contribute to the documentation hosted at http://easybuild.readthedocs.io/,
you should open a pull request to the <span class="s">``develop``</span> branch of the
main EasyBuild repository at https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild; see the <span class="s">``docs``</span> subdirectory.

A particularly useful tool is http://rst.ninjs.org/, which can be used to
preview how the documentation written in <span class="s">``reStructuredText``</span> format
will be rendered on <span class="s">``readthedocs.org``</span> (select the <span class="s">``Nature``</span> theme for optimal
results).


<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_conversation:</span>

<span class="gh">Joining the conversation</span>
<span class="gh">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>

Last but not least, you can actively <span class="gs">**join the conversation**</span> that arise on the EasyBuild
mailing list, the <span class="s">``#easybuild``</span> IRC channel and during the bi-weekly EasyBuild
conference calls (see https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild/wiki/Conference-calls).

Engage with the EasyBuild community, and help steer EasyBuild development by participating
in the conversations regarding a variety of topics related to building and installing (scientific) software.


<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_pull_requests:</span>

<span class="gh">Pull requests</span>
<span class="gh">-------------</span>

To contribute to the EasyBuild framework, easyblocks, easyconfig files
or the EasyBuild documentation, you will need to open a <span class="gs">**pull request**</span> to the
corresponding GitHub repository:

<span class="m">*</span> EasyBuild framework: https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework
<span class="m">*</span> easyblocks: https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks
<span class="m">*</span> easyconfigs: https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs
<span class="m">*</span> documentation: https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild (see <span class="s">``docs``</span> subdirectory)

Doing this the traditional way requires some knowledge about using <span class="s">``git``</span>
(i.e. creating commits, using branches, pushing to and pulling from remote
Git repositories, etc.), and being familiar with GitHub.

**However, this can be largely circumvented by using the GitHub integration
provided by EasyBuild, see<span class="gs">** :ref:`integration_with_github` **</span>.**


<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_pull_request_setup:</span>

<span class="gh">Setting up</span>
<span class="gh">~~~~~~~~~~</span>

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">note</span><span class="p">::</span> These instructions assume that you already have a working GitHub account.

          If you don&#39;t have a GitHub account yet, visit https://github.com/ to create one.

          We highly recommend registering your SSH public key in your GitHub account,
          via https://github.com/settings/keys. This allows pushing to your fork of
          the GitHub repositories without using a password.

Before you can open pull requests, you will need to <span class="gs">**fork**</span> the GitHub repository
you are targeting, and create a local <span class="gs">**working copy**</span> of that repository. This only
needs to be done <span class="ge">*once*</span> for every of the EasyBuild repositories.

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">note</span><span class="p">::</span> For the purpose of this guide, we will be using the <span class="s">``easybuild-framework``</span> repository.

          However, the instructions are equivalent for the other EasyBuild repositories.

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_pull_request_setup_fork_repo:</span>

<span class="gh">Forking the repository</span>
<span class="gh">++++++++++++++++++++++</span>

First, create your own <span class="ge">*fork*</span> of the repository in your GitHub account using the
&#39;<span class="s">``Fork``</span>&#39; button on the top right at https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework.

This will create a &#39;copy&#39; of the <span class="s">``easybuild-framework``</span> repository
owned by the <span class="s">``easybuilders``</span> GitHub organisation to your own personal GitHub account.

You will have to use this fork as a staging area for your work,
to prepare your contributions before creating the actual pull requests.

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_pull_request_setup_working_copy:</span>

<span class="gh">Creating a working copy</span>
<span class="gh">+++++++++++++++++++++++</span>

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">note</span><span class="p">::</span> Do not forget to replace &#39;<span class="s">``EXAMPLE``</span>&#39; with your GitHub account name in the instructions below.

In addition to forking the repository on GitHub, you also need to create
a local <span class="ge">*working copy*</span> of the repository. This is basically a local checkout
of the repository where you can track the changes you are making.

First, <span class="ge">*clone*</span> your fork of the repository:

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">code</span><span class="p">::</span> <span class="k">shell</span>

  git clone git@github.com:EXAMPLE/easybuild-framework.git

If that worked as expected, you should have a new directory named <span class="s">``easybuild-framework``</span>.
Move into the <span class="s">``easybuild-framework``</span> directory:

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">code</span><span class="p">::</span> <span class="k">shell</span>

  <span class="nb">cd</span> easybuild-framework

Finally, we recommended to also check out the <span class="s">``develop``</span> branch,
which will be used as the base for your own branches:

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">code</span><span class="p">::</span> <span class="k">shell</span>

  git checkout -b develop origin/develop

With this in place, you are all set to open pull requests for your contributions.

<span class="gh">Keeping the ``develop`` branch in sync</span>
<span class="gh">######################################</span>

It is important to keep the <span class="s">``develop``</span> branch in your working copy in sync
with the upstream repository in the GitHub <span class="s">``easybuilders``</span> organization.

For this, you need to add the upstream repository as a &#39;<span class="ge">*remote*</span>&#39; repository:

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">code</span><span class="p">::</span> <span class="k">shell</span>

  git remote add upstream git@github.com:easybuilders/easybuild-framework.git

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">note</span><span class="p">::</span> &#39;<span class="s">``upstream``</span>&#39; is just a name that you give to the remote the central
          <span class="s">``easybuilders``</span> repository on GitHub; you can modify this to your liking
          if desired (but do take that into account for the further instructions if you do so).

          For your fork of the repository, a default remote named <span class="s">``origin``</span> should
          have been created via <span class="s">``git clone``</span> (see the output of <span class="s">``git remote -v``</span>).

To sync your <span class="s">``develop``</span> branch, use <span class="s">``git pull upstream develop``</span> after making
sure you have the <span class="s">``develop``</span> branch checked out:

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">code</span><span class="p">::</span> <span class="k">shell</span>

  git checkout develop
  git pull upstream develop


<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_creating_pull_requests:</span>

<span class="gh">Opening a new pull request</span>
<span class="gh">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">note</span><span class="p">::</span> This section describes the manual procedure to open a new pull request.

          Please consider using <span class="s">``eb --new-pr``</span> instead, see <span class="na">:ref:</span><span class="nv">`github_new_pr`</span>.

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">note</span><span class="p">::</span> We assume you are already located in your local working copy of
          the repository you want to contribute to (e.g., <span class="s">``easybuild-framework``</span>).

To open a pull request for your contribution, you must follow these steps:

<span class="m">i.</span> <span class="na">:ref:</span><span class="nv">`contributing_creating_pull_requests_branch`</span>
<span class="m">ii.</span> <span class="na">:ref:</span><span class="nv">`contributing_creating_pull_requests_commit`</span>

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_creating_pull_requests_branch:</span>

<span class="gh">Creating a new branch</span>
<span class="gh">+++++++++++++++++++++</span>

First, create a new branch for your work. You can do this either before
or after making the changes that you would like to contribute, but we
recommend to create a new branch before making any changes.

Make sure you have the <span class="s">``develop``</span> branch checked out before creating your branch:

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">code</span><span class="p">::</span> <span class="k">shell</span>

  git checkout develop

To create a new branch, you should use <span class="s">``git branch &lt;branch_name&gt;``</span> followed by
<span class="s">``git checkout &lt;branch_name&gt;``</span>, or equivalently <span class="s">``git checkout -b &lt;branch_name&gt;``</span>.

For example, to create a new branch named <span class="s">``mybranch``</span>:

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">code</span><span class="p">::</span> <span class="k">shell</span>

  git checkout -b mybranch

You can choose the branch name freely, but make it sufficiently descriptive --
your future self will thank you.


<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_creating_pull_requests_commit:</span>

<span class="gh">Committing your changes</span>
<span class="gh">+++++++++++++++++++++++</span>

To &#39;save&#39; your changes, you should create one or more <span class="ge">*commits*</span> in the branch
you created. We recommended making separate commits for different &#39;units of work&#39;.

First, make sure you have checked out the branch were you want to commit the changes to.
For example, to prepare for committing changes to the <span class="s">``mybranch``</span> branch:

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">code</span><span class="p">::</span> <span class="k">shell</span>

  git checkout mybranch

To check which branch is currently checked out, use <span class="s">``git branch``</span>.

To get a high-level overview of the changes before committing them, you can use <span class="s">``git status``</span>.

To see the actual changes that were made, use <span class="s">``git diff``</span>.

To commit the changes you want to contribute, use <span class="s">``git add &lt;files&gt;``</span>
to <span class="ge">*stage*</span> the changes, followed by <span class="s">``git commit -m &quot;&lt;message&gt;&quot;``</span> to create
the actual commit.

For example, to commit the changes that were made to <span class="s">``easybuild/tools/filetools.py``</span>:

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">code</span><span class="p">::</span> <span class="k">shell</span>

  git add easybuild/tools/filetools.py
  git status  <span class="c1"># check which files are staged for commit</span>
  git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;example commit message for changes to filetools.py&quot;</span>

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">note</span><span class="p">::</span> Please use a concise commit message that describes the changes you made.

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">note</span><span class="p">::</span> For files that are already being tracked, you can use <span class="s">``git commit -am &lt;message&gt;``</span>
          to commit all changes at once.

To verify that your work was committed, use <span class="s">``git log``</span> to see all commits
on the current branch. Use <span class="s">``git log --stat``</span> and/or <span class="s">``git log --diff``</span> to see
more details about which changes are included in each of the commits.


<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_creating_pull_requests_push:</span>

<span class="gh">Pushing your branch</span>
<span class="gh">+++++++++++++++++++</span>

Once you have committed your changes to a branch, you should <span class="ge">*push*</span> your
branch to your fork of the GitHub repository using <span class="s">``git push``</span>.

For example, to push the <span class="s">``mybranch``</span> branch to your fork of the GitHub repository
(via the <span class="s">``origin``</span> remote, see <span class="na">:ref:</span><span class="nv">`contributing_pull_request_setup_working_copy`</span>):

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">code</span><span class="p">::</span> <span class="k">shell</span>

  git push origin mybranch

Note: this will make your work public.


<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_creating_pull_requests_pr_title:</span>

<span class="gh">Pull request title &amp; description</span>
<span class="gh">++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</span>

Please use a descriptive (short) title for your pull requests, and clarify (if needed) in the pull request description.

If any other pull requests are required, refer to them in the description using <span class="s">``#&lt;PR number&gt;``</span> (only for pull requests
to the same repository), or by copy-pasting the URL to the pull request.

For pull requests to the easyconfig repository, we recommend using this format for the pull request title
when contributing new easyconfig files<span class="se">::</span>

<span class="s">  {&lt;moduleclass&gt;}[&lt;toolchain&gt;] &lt;software name&gt; &lt;software version&gt; &lt;extra info&gt;</span>

For example:

<span class="m">*</span> <span class="s">``{tools}[dummy] EasyBuild v3.2.1``</span>
<span class="m">*</span> <span class="s">``{math}[intel/2017a] numpy 1.13.0 w/ Python 2.7.13``</span>
<span class="m">*</span> <span class="s">``{math,numlib}[foss/2017a] METIS v5.1.0, ParMETIS v4.0.3, SuiteSparse v4.5.5, ...``</span>

If you are opening a work-in-progress pull request, for example to solicit feedback, tag it using <span class="s">``(WIP)``</span>.
in the pull request title.

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_creating_pull_requests_open_pr:</span>

<span class="gh">Opening the pull request</span>
<span class="gh">++++++++++++++++++++++++</span>

To open a pull request using the branch you pushed,
you should use the GitHub interface, and follow the steps outlined below.

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">note</span><span class="p">::</span> Replace &#39;<span class="s">``EXAMPLE``</span>&#39; with your GitHub account name, and
          &#39;<span class="s">``easybuild-framework``</span>&#39; with the name of the target EasyBuild repository.

<span class="m">i.</span> visit https://github.com/EXAMPLE/easybuild-framework;
<span class="m">ii.</span> switch to the branch that includes the changes you want to contribute
    using the &#39;<span class="s">``Branch: main``</span>&#39; button on the left,
    for example by selecting <span class="s">``Branch: mybranch``</span> from the dropdown list
<span class="m">iii.</span> click the &#39;<span class="s">``New pull request``</span>&#39; button;
<span class="m">iv.</span> change the target branch to <span class="s">``develop``</span> using the &#39;<span class="s">``base: main``</span>&#39; button;
<span class="m">v.</span> review your changes using the &#39;diff&#39; view presented by GitHub;
<span class="m">vi.</span> provide an appropriate title and description for your contribution;
<span class="m">vii.</span> open the pull request by clicking the green &#39;<span class="s">``Create pull request``</span>&#39; button

Next, your pull request will be reviewed &amp; tested, see <span class="na">:ref:</span><span class="nv">`contributing_review_process`</span>.

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_updating_pull_requests:</span>

<span class="gh">Updating existing pull requests</span>
<span class="gh">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">note</span><span class="p">::</span> This section describes the manual procedure to create a new pull request.

          Please consider using <span class="s">``eb --update-pr``</span> instead, see <span class="na">:ref:</span><span class="nv">`github_update_pr`</span>.

It is quite common to update a pull request after creating it,
for example if the test suite run in GitHub Actions reports problems with the changes being made, or as a response
to someone reviewing your contribution.

To update an existing pull request, it suffices to add commits to the branch
that was used for opening the pull request, and pushing the updated branch to GitHub.

For example, to update the pull request that was created using the <span class="s">``mybranch``</span> branch:

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">code</span><span class="p">::</span> <span class="k">shell</span>

  git checkout mybranch
  <span class="c1"># make changes...</span>
  git add &lt;paths to changed files&gt;
  git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;example commit message for additional changes&quot;</span>
  git push origin mybranch

Updating a pull request will trigger GitHub Actions to re-test your contribution,
and a notification will be sent out to whoever is &#39;watching&#39; your pull request.


<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_merging_pull_requests:</span>

<span class="gh">Merging of pull requests</span>
<span class="gh">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>

Once your pull request has been given the green light by GitHub Actions and one or more
people reviewing have approved the changes, it can be merged into
the <span class="s">``develop``</span> branch.

**This can only be done by a member of the EasyBuild maintainers team.
Only pull requests that meet the requirements are eligible for merging,
see<span class="gs">** :ref:`contributing_review_process_pr_requirements` **</span>.**

Merging a pull request usually implies that the changes will be part of the next EasyBuild release.

<span class="gs">**Pull requests are only merged in the**</span> &#39;<span class="s">``develop``</span>&#39; <span class="gs">**branch**</span> of the EasyBuild repositories,
which contains the changes that will be included in the next EasyBuild release.

The &#39;<span class="s">``main``</span>&#39; branch provides the latest stable release of EasyBuild at all times.
Only the EasyBuild release manager should issue a pull request to the EasyBuild &#39;<span class="s">``main``</span>&#39; branch,
when preparing a new EasyBuild release.

Occasionally, an additional version branch (e.g. &#39;<span class="s">``3.3.x``</span>&#39;) may be introduced temporarily,
in case an intermittent bugfix release is being worked on.

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_review_process_github_actions:</span>

<span class="gh">Test suite (GitHub Actions)</span>
<span class="gh">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>

Each pull request is tested automatically by <span class="s">`GitHub Actions </span><span class="si">&lt;https://github.com/features/actions&gt;</span><span class="s">`_</span>
and the test result is reported in the pull request.

**Only pull requests that have been tested and approved by GitHub Actions are
eligible for being merged!**

Note that GitHub Actions will only run the <span class="ge">*test suite*</span> for that particular repository.
That is, for easyconfig contributions it does <span class="ge">*not*</span> include
actually building and installing software.

For more information on the test suites, see <span class="na">:ref:</span><span class="nv">`unit_tests`</span>.

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_review_process_adding_tests:</span>

<span class="gh">Adding tests</span>
<span class="gh">++++++++++++</span>

An implicit requirement for contributions, in particular contributions to the EasyBuild framework,
is that they <span class="gs">**must be accompanied by additional tests or test cases**</span>.

For new features or enhancements, a dedicated test (case) must be added
which verifies that the feature implementation works as expected.

For bug fixes, a test (case) must be added that triggers the code path where the bug manifested,
and which verifies that the bug was indeed fixed.

Tests not only confirm that the implementation is correct, it also helps to ensure
that any future changes will not break the functionality you contributed.


<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_review_process_backward_compatibility:</span>

<span class="gh">Backward compatibility</span>
<span class="gh">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>

<span class="gs">**Contributions should retain backward compatibility**</span>, i.e., they should <span class="ge">*not*</span>
make any changes that alter the (default) functionality of the existing code base.
Of course, enhancements to existing code that retain backward compatibility can be made.

One exception to this rule is <span class="ge">*bug fixes*</span>, where the whole point is usually
to fix functionality that was implemented incorrectly.

This also applies to existing easyconfig files; for example, the versions
of dependencies should <span class="ge">*not*</span> be altered. Adding dependencies that were missing
or otherwise enhancing existing easyconfigs (e.g., adding extra extensions,
enabling additional features, etc.) are usually considered acceptable.

Changes that break backward compatibility have to be motivated
well with technical arguments, and must be approved by the EasyBuild maintainers.


<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_review_process_code_style:</span>

<span class="gh">Code style review</span>
<span class="gh">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>

Next to functional evaluation of contributions, care is also taken to
maintain a consistent code style across the EasyBuild code base
(see also <span class="na">:ref:</span><span class="nv">`code_style`</span>);
<span class="gs">**contributions must take the (mostly PEP8) code style into account.**</span>

This aspect is sometimes considered to be needless overhead, yet it is an
important aspect of the review process. A consistent code style is invaluable
in a large code base that is constantly being updated by a worldwide community.

This also applies to easyconfig files, where we try to maintain a strict style
that mostly matches the established PEP8 coding style for Python (since
easyconfigs are written in Python syntax). However, also the grouping and
ordering of easyconfig parameters is a part of the &#39;code&#39; style we maintain.

An automated (partial) check to see whether easyconfig files are ready to
be contributed can be performed via <span class="s">``eb --check-contrib``</span>. This will check:

<span class="m">*</span> style aspects for the specified easyconfig files
<span class="m">*</span> whether SHA256 checksums are included for all source files &amp; patches

This check is also a part of the test suite run by GitHub Actions for easyconfig PRs.


<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_review_process_review_pr:</span>

<span class="gh">Comparing with existing easyconfigs (``--review-pr``)</span>
<span class="gh">+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</span>

We try to maintain <span class="gs">**consistency across easyconfig files**</span> for a particular
software package, across multiple software versions, toolchains and variants
(with a different <span class="s">``versionsuffix``</span>).

Therefore, easyconfig contributions are also reviewed using <span class="s">``eb --review-pr &lt;PR #&gt;``</span>,
which compares the touched easyconfig files to those in the current
<span class="s">``develop``</span> branch that are most closely related.

The easyconfig files to compare with are selected based on similarity,
by combining two criteria, in order.

First, the software version is taken into account, using one of the following
criteria:

<span class="m">*</span> exact match on software version match
<span class="m">*</span> match on major/minor software version
<span class="m">*</span> match on major software version
<span class="m">*</span> no match on software version

This is combined with one of the criteria below (in order):

<span class="m">*</span> matching versionsuffix and toolchain name/version
<span class="m">*</span> matching versionsuffix and toolchain name (any toolchain version)
<span class="m">*</span> matching versionsuffix (any toolchain name/version)
<span class="m">*</span> matching toolchain name/version (any versionsuffix)
<span class="m">*</span> matching toolchain name (any versionsuffix, toolchain version)
<span class="m">*</span> no extra requirements (any versionsuffix, toolchain name/version)

The first combination of one of the software version criteria with one of
the other criteria that yields one or more matching easyconfig files is used.
If none of the combinations match, no easyconfig files for that particular software
package are available yet, and no comparison is made.

The output of <span class="s">``--review-pr``</span> provides a &#39;multidiff&#39; comparison, which highlights
the differences between the easyconfig file in the pull request and the most similar
selected ones from the current <span class="s">``develop``</span> branch.

For example:

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="ow">raw</span><span class="p">::</span> html

  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://asciinema.org/a/103889.js&quot; id=&quot;asciicast-103889&quot; async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

Interpreting this output is a quick and easy way to assess how different the
contributed easyconfig files are from the existing easyconfigs, although it
does require a bit of practice because of the density of the provided information.


<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_review_process_test_reports:</span>

<span class="gh">Test reports for easyconfig contributions (``upload-test-report``)</span>
<span class="gh">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>

For easyconfig contributions, one or more accompanying <span class="gs">**test reports must be submitted**</span> to confirm that the added and/or changed easyconfig files (still) work as expected.

We recommend that you submit a test report for your own easyconfig pull requests.
Other people can also submit test reports to confirm that your contribution works as expected on their system(s).

With EasyBuild being properly configured (see <span class="na">:ref:</span><span class="nv">`github_configuration`</span>), this should be as simple as running <span class="s">``eb --from-pr &lt;PR#&gt; --upload-test-report --force --robot``</span>.

See <span class="na">:ref:</span><span class="nv">`github_upload_test_report`</span> for more information.


<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_review_process_do_not_merge_your_own_prs:</span>

<span class="gh">Pull requests are merged by a maintainer other than the author</span>
<span class="gh">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>

<span class="gs">**A pull request should never be merged by its author.**</span>

This policy is maintained in order to ensure a <span class="ge">*&quot;two-pairs-of-eyes&quot;*</span> review process of all contributions.

<span class="p">..</span> <span class="nt">_contributing_review_process_why_pr_closed_by_maintainer:</span>

<span class="gh">Why a pull request may be closed by a maintainer</span>
<span class="gh">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>

Although it is generally avoided, there are a few reasons why maintainers might close a pull request:

<span class="m">*</span> uses an archived toolchain
<span class="m">*</span> no activity for &gt; 6 months
<span class="m">*</span> obsolete because more recent PRs for newer versions of the software have been merged already

This is done routinely as a way of focusing everyone&#39;s efforts on relevant contributions, and should not be seen as a rejection. 
In fact, contributors are encouraged to reopen the pull request if they feel it is still relevant.
