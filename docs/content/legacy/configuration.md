Configuration Legacy
====================

.. XXX - UPDATE BY VERSION

Legacy configuration is currently **deprecated!**

If you are a new user of EasyBuild you can safely ignore everything below this line,
refer instead to :doc:`Configuration`.

--------


Porting from legacy configuration style
---------------------------------------

In EasyBuild v1.x, a couple of configuration options, other than the standard ones aligned with variables,
are available that follow the **legacy configuration style**, including:

-  the ``-C`` and ``--config`` command line arguments ( **use** ``--configfiles`` **instead** )
-  the ``$EASYBUILDCONFIG`` environment variable ( **use** ``$EASYBUILD_CONFIGFILES`` **instead** )
-  the default path ``$HOME/.easybuild/config.py`` ( **new-style default path is** ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/easybuild/config.cfg``)
-  the legacy fallback path ``<installpath>/easybuild/easybuild_config.py`` ( **only default/fallback path is** ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/easybuild/config.cfg``)

Likewise, the following legacy environment variables allowed to override selected configuration settings:

-  ``$EASYBUILDBUILDPATH``: build path to be used by EasyBuild ( **use** ``$EASYBUILD_BUILDPATH`` **instead** )
-  ``$EASYBUILDINSTALLPATH``: install path to be used by EasyBuild ( **use** ``$EASYBUILD_INSTALLPATH`` **instead** )
-  ``$EASYBUILDSOURCEPATH``: source path to be used by EasyBuild ( **use** ``$EASYBUILD_SOURCEPATH`` **instead** )
-  ``$EASYBUILDPREFIX``: build/install/source path prefix to be used ( **use** ``$EASYBUILD_PREFIX`` **instead** )

We *strongly* advise to switch to the new way of configuring EasyBuild as soon as possible,
since the legacy configuration style will no longer be supported in EasyBuild v2.x.


How EasyBuild used to be configured in the early days
-----------------------------------------------------

Configuring `EasyBuild` is done by providing a configuration file.

EasyBuild expects the configuration file to contain valid Python code,
because it executes its contents (using ``exec``).
The rationale is that this approach provides a lot of flexibility for
configuring EasyBuild.

EasyBuild will use the file that is provided by the path/filename in the
following order of preference:

-  path/filename specified on the EasyBuild command line (using ``--config``),
-  path/filename obtained from the environment variable ``EASYBUILDCONFIG`` (if it is defined)
-  ``$HOME/.easybuild/config.py`` (as of EasyBuild v1.1)
-  the (default) configuration file at
   ``<path where EasyBuild was installed>/easybuild/easybuild_config.py``

Configuration variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration file must define the following five variables:
``build_path``, ``install_path``, ``source_path``, ``repository``, and ``log_format``.
If one of them is not defined, EasyBuild will complain and exit.

Build path (required)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``build_path`` variable specifies the directory in which EasyBuild
builds its software packages.

Each software package is (by default) built in a subdirectory of the
``build_path`` under ``<name>/<version>/<toolchain><versionsuffix>``.

Note that the build directories are emptied by EasyBuild when the
installation is completed (by default).

Install path (required)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``install_path`` variable specifies the directory in which EasyBuild
installs software packages and the corresponding module files.

The packages themselves are installed under ``install_path/software``
in their own subdirectory aptly named
``<name>/<version>-<toolchain><versionsuffix>``
(by default), where name is the package name. The corresponding module
files are installed under ``install_path/modules``.

**Setting $MODULEPATH**

After the configuration, you need to make sure that ``$MODULEPATH``
environment variable is extended with the ``modules/all`` subdirectory
of the ``install_path``, i.e.:

.. code:: bash

    export MODULEPATH=<install_path>/modules/all:$MODULEPATH

It is probably a good idea to add this to your (favourite) shell .rc
file, e.g., ``.bashrc``, and/or the ``.profile`` login scripts, so you do not need to adjust the ``$MODULEPATH`` variable every time
you start a new session.

Source path (required)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``source_path`` variable specifies the directory in which EasyBuild
looks for software source and install files.

Similarly to the configuration file lookup, EasyBuild looks for the
installation files as given by the ``sources`` variable in the .eb easyconfig file, in the following order of preference:

-  ``<source_path>/<name>``: a subdirectory determined by the name of the software package
-  ``<source_path>/<letter>/<name>``: in the style of the
   ``easyblocks``/``easyconfigs`` directories:
   in a subdirectory determined by the first letter (in lower case) of
   the software package and by its full ``name``
-  ``<source_path>``: directly in the source path

Note that these locations are also used when EasyBuild looks for patch
files in addition to the various ``easybuild/easyconfigs`` directories that are listed in the ``$PYTHONPATH``.
