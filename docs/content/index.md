# Welcome to the EasyBuild documentation!

!!! warning
    This is the new EasyBuild documentation,
    made with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material)
    and written in [MarkDown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).

    We intend to replace the <https://docs.easybuild.io>,
    which is made with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org)
    and written in [reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText)
    with this documentation soon...

    **
    If you want to help with porting the EasyBuild documentation to MarkDown, you can!  
    Please see <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-docs>.
